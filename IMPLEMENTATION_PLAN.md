## Development Notes

### After Each Phase

- Test all functionality on desktop and mobile
- Update TypeScript types as needed
- Refactor components for reusability
- Update this plan with learnings

### Key Considerations

- Start with simple implementations, iterate to add complexity
- Test UI components with real data from FastAPI service
- Keep all external API calls abstracted in backend service layer
- Frontend communicates only with internal FastAPI service
- Maintain responsive design throughout development
- Handle API errors gracefully with proper user feedback
- Implement proper JWT token refresh logic
- Never use placeholder or mock data - always integrate with live service API
- Handle file processing errors and provide user feedback
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Voice commands integration for hands-free operation
- Advanced segment-based playback with smart resumption
- Real-time collaborative Q&A sessions during playback
- Advanced topic modeling and content categorization
- User preference learning algorithms with feedback loops
- Social features (sharing, playlists, discussions)
- Multi-language transcription and translation support
- Advanced analytics dashboard for content insights
- Integration with external podcast APIs for metadata enrichment
