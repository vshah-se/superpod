## Core Features

### Authentication & User Profiling
- Simple user authentication for personalized experiences
- User interest extraction based on listening history and interactions
- Profile building based on listened content, search patterns, and chat interactions

### Discovery & Personalization
- Interest-based podcast recommendations from local media library
- Natural language search with vector similarity ("Find podcasts about startup funding")
- Learning user preferences through chat interactions and listening history
- Semantic search through transcribed content

### Content Exploration
- AI-generated podcast synopses with personalized highlights from transcriptions
- Segment-level content breakdown with precise timestamps
- Topic extraction and categorization per episode using AI analysis
- Full-text search within transcriptions

### Smart Playback
- Direct media file streaming from local storage
- Standard podcast playback controls (play, pause, skip, volume, seek)
- Transcription-based navigation and search within episodes
- Segment-specific playback based on user interests and AI analysis
- Skip to relevant parts functionality using transcribed timestamps

### Intelligent Playback Control
- **Natural Language Commands**: Users can say "play the part about startup funding" to jump directly to relevant segments
- **Intent Recognition**: AI automatically detects playback requests and triggers segment playback
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Chat interface provides both conversation and immediate segment access
- **Seamless Integration**: No separate buttons needed - chat and playback work as one unified experience

### Interactive Q&A Experience
- Real-time Q&A via text about podcast content with automatic segment playback
- Context-aware answers generated from transcriptions with direct links to relevant moments
- **Smart Segment Discovery**: AI identifies and plays the most relevant 30-60 second segments based on user questions
- Automatic resume: continue playback exactly where the listener paused after questions are answered

### Conversational Interface
- **Voice-to-Playback Flow**: "Show me the AI discussion" â†’ Instant segment playback
- **Contextual Discovery**: AI suggests related segments during conversation
- **Playback Integration**: Chat responses include playable segment previews
- Hands-free content exploration through natural conversation
